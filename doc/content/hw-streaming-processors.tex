The Streaming Processors(SP) goes under various different names including Scalar-Processors, Execution Units or the more famous CUDA Cores by Nvidia.
SPs are the basic computing elements of a GPU, they perform fundamental operations, such as integer, floating-point, comparison and type conversions \cite{Li2016}.
SPs are much like the cores located in CPUs, containing similarities such as simultaneous multi-threading (SMT).



%Increasing the number of cores, compared to an Intel P4, is
%performed due to the lack of certain complex features that are usually implemented
%on standard processors, including out-of-order execution, cache memory, and call
%stack. In addition, the cores are organized into groups of eight, each with two texture
%units, a texture cache and shared memory.
