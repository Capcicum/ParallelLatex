Back in 1966 Michael J. Flynn proposed  a system to identify computer architectures designs and functionalities in four different classifications \cite{Flynn1972}. 
The four classifications defined by Flynn were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Single Instruction, Single Data (SISD)
	\item Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD)
	\item Multiple Instruction, Single Data (MISD)
	\item Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD)
\end{itemize}

These four classifications are based on the number of instruction streams and data streams available in the computer architecture.
For instance, SISD only allows for one instruction to be peformed on data input at a time, corresponding to a single-core CPU.
Where MIMD allows for multiple different instructions to be performed on multiple different data inputs, corresponding to multi-core CPUs.

GPUs implement another classification, namely the SIMT, Single Instruction, Multiple Thread.
Compared with SIMD, SIMT allows for multithreading,
