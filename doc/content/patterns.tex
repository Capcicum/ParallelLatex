In parallel computing tasks (threads) need to work together to solve a given problem. 
To be able to solve a problem the different tasks need to communicate with each other.
There are different parallel communications patterns such as map, transpose, gather and stencil.
Such communication patterns are essential for implementing more complex parallel algorithms.
