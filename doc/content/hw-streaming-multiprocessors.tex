\textit{Special Function Units (SFUs)} are a approximation units, which computes fast approximations of transcendental functions such as sine, cosine, reciprocal and square root.
%Each SFU also features four floating-point multipliers that can offer extra FP throughput in addition to SPs. The SFU pipelines are independent from the SP pipelines.
