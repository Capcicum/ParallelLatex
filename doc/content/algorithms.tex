The idea of the GPU is to have multiple threads worikng togther solving a common problem in an efficient way. Parallel communication patterns can be used to solve a subset of parallel computation problems, but, to solve larger similar problems parallel algorithms are important. Algorithms use a defined number of steps or procedures to solve different types of problems. Many of the algorithms know for the serial computation, may be inefficient or inadequate for parallelization, so it is important to understand the parallel counterparts. This section will describe and discuss some of the must important algorithms for the parallel programming including reduction, scan, histogram and sort.
