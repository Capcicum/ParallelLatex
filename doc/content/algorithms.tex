We distinguished between two performance evaluations for parallel patterns and algorithms namely step and work efficiency. Step complexity determines the amount of steps or iterations the pattern or algorithm shall perform before arriving at the result. A parallel pattern or algorithm is considered step-efficient if it s step complexity is lower than its serial counterpart. Work complexity determines is the amount of operations needed to arrive at the result. A pattern or algorithm is considered work efficient its work complexity is lower than its serial counterpart.
