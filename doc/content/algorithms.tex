The idea behind the GPU is to have multiple threads working together, solving a common problem, in an efficient way. Parallel communication patterns can be used to solve a subset of parallel computation problems, but to solve larger similar problems, parallel algorithms are important. Algorithms use a defined number of steps or procedures to solve different types of problems. Many of the algorithms known from serial computation, may be inefficient or inadequate for parallelization, so it is important to know the only parallel algorithms. This section will describe and discuss some of the important algorithms for parallel programming including reduction, scan, histogram, sort, compact and allocate.
