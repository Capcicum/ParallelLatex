Modern software programmers have been using standard processing unit architectures, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs) for decades, where highly developed compilers help utilizing the underlying hardware.
However, Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) programmers must have considerable knowledge of the underlying hardware architecture to fully achieve optimized and efficient performances results.
Achieving such knowledge can be difficult as the architecture comes in many variations.
This is a result the major development of which GPUs has been undergoing, from the first emerging back in the late 1990s to the newest upcoming architectures not yet released.

The following sections first briefly describes the early evolution of GPUs, leading to the birth of General Purpose Graphical Processing Unit (GPGPU).
Hereafter, the general GPGPU hardware architecture is described in details, including its memory model.
Lastly,
